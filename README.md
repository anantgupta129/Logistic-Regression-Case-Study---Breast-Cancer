# Logistic-Regression-Case-Study---Breast-Cancer
This example uses gradient descent to fit the model. It also contains a Scikit Learn's way of doing logistic regression, so we can compare the two implementations.
A case study on using Logistic Regression. The dataset is from UCI machine learning repository. This ML algorithm is optimized by using K-fold and grid search 
and also comparison is shown in jupyter notebook
